				<div class="mani"><p>A man with highest priorities and familiar to the word passion and 
				meaning of the word superficiality</p>
				<p>Engineers, as practitioners of engineering, are professionals who invent, design, analyze,
				 build and test machines, complex systems, structures, gadgets and 
				materials to fulfill functional objectives and requirements while considering the limitations 
				imposed by practicality, regulation, safety and cost.[1][2] The word engineer (Latin ingeniator[3]) is derived from the 
				Latin words ingeniare ("to create, generate, contrive, devise") and ingenium ("cleverness").[4][5] The foundational qualifications of an engineer typically include a four-year bachelor's degree in an engineering discipline, or in some jurisdictions, a master's degree in an engineering discipline plus four to six years of peer-reviewed professional practice (culminating in a project report or thesis) 
				and passage of engineering board examinations.</p></div>

			<h1>A VISION</h1>

			<div class="ajay"><p>
				A professional engineer is competent by virtue of his/her fundamental education and training to apply the scientific method and outlook to the analysis and solution of engineering problems.<br> 
<br>He/she is able to assume personal responsibility for the development and application of engineering science and knowledge, notably in research, design, construction, manufacturing, superintending, managing and in the education of the engineer. His/her work is predominantly intellectual and varied and not of a routine mental or physical character. It requires the exercise of original thought and judgement and the ability to supervise the technical and administrative work of others. His/her education will have been such as to make him/her capable of closely and continuously following progress in h
is/her branch of engineering science by consulting newly published works on a worldwide basis, assimilating such information and applying it independently.
